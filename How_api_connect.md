# How to connect to MLA api

1. Have an active MLA account. To create a new account, enter www.mercadolibre.com.ar and select the option Create your account.
2. Once logged into your account, go to https://developers.mercadolibre.com.ar/ there you can read all the API documentation.
3. Go to https://developers.mercadolibre.com.ar/devcenter/accountLink to link your account with the API.
4. Now that the account is linked, it is necessary to create an application. You can follow the steps indicated in the documentation at https://developers.mercadolibre.com.ar/es_ar/registra-tu-aplicacion.
5. As the application asks us for a URL, use localtunnel.
Localtunnel allows you to easily share a web service on your local development machine without messing with DNS and firewall settings.
